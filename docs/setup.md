# Setting up an environment for this package
_________________________________________________________

### Will be working on allowing the package to work with less stringent file structures/environments

<br />
<br />

## Current Requirements

<br />

- Windows (only tested on 10)
- Python >= 3.9.1 (only tested with Miniconda)
- Required libraries for Python as listed in the requirements.txt file
- Git Bash
- Excel 2016 or higher

<br />

## Setting up the Git Environment

<br />

- Download the git bash terminal from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    - Install with recommended settings
- Right click in folder you'd like to contain the package, and click `git bash here`:
    - ![Open Git Bash](images/open_git_bash.png)
- Once the window is open, use the instructions to set up your gitHub profile/connect it to Git Bash.
- Next, type: `git clone https://github.com/jbarnell1/KHEL_WGS_SARS_CoV_2.git` 
    - Alternatively, paste with right click --> Paste
- The package should now appear in your folder, and you're set!

- `cd` to the `KHEL_WGS_SC2` package
- type the following command: ``
